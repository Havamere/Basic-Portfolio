					<p id="my_story">My goal is to encompass my many years of managerial experience and customer service into a successful career as a web developer.  I am a graduate of Kent State University in Ohio and of UCF's Coding Bootcamp.  My interest in web development started at the age of 12, when I got to design my very own webpage using "angelfire.com".  I have spent the majority of my live thus far playing to my strengths; cooking and interpersonal skills, like customer service.  Web design has proven to be both challenging and very rewarding.  It is artistic in many ways because you really do create something from literaly nothing.  I am really looking forward to what future this career path will bring.<br><br>
					This Bootcamp is a lot of hard work after long days at my current job, but the teachers are great and I am learning a great deal.  I can't wait to see the kind of developer I turn out to be on the other side of this.
